When one sees videos of recent robots achieving multi-contact manipulation or locomotion, one wonders why they are slow when they come to contacts? The main reason in all cases is simple: robots fear impacts, unlike humans, nowadays robots handle contact tasks with near-zero velocity. This workshop will contribute to the state-of-the-art robot manipulation and locomotion by developing new motion generation paradigms to exploit impacts (single or multiple) that enables the following:

<ul>
  <li> swift motion while physically interacting with the environment with multiple complex impacts, 
  <li> exploiting energetic contact transitions for robot manipulation and locomotion. 
</ul> 

These unprecedented locomotion and manipulation skills enable robots to deal with tasks that can not be achieved otherwise, such as such as swinging a hammer to fix nails, wedging a wooden component into the scaffold, and manipulating boxes without stopping.  
<br/>


Most of the robots are not manufactured to mitigate high external impulses. Fragile components, such as the harmonics, significantly limit the maximum impulse a robot can take. Instead of being rigidly mounted on a fixed-base, under-actuated robots have to balance themselves using contacts that (i) can only provide unilateral supporting forces, (ii) include limited contact areas, e.g., a partial foothold, and (iii) can change over time. Thus, we aim to bring the latest developments to answer specific questions on both hardware design and control software that include but not limited to:

 <ul>
  <li>How to perform timely impact/collision detection?</li>
  <li>How to improve the hardware design to mitigate high external impulses?</li>
  <li>How to properly model the frictional impact dynamics ?</li>
  <li>How to balance the under-actuated floating-base while executing high dynamic motion?</li>
  <li>How to stabilize the robot states given multiple impacts?</li>
  <li>How to preview and exploit the impact-induced state jumps for model-based controllers?</li>
</ul>
