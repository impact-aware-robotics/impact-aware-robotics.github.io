title: "Frictional Impact Dynamics Model"

excerpt: "
To enable impact-awareness in the model-based motion generation paradigms of under-actuated robots, we need the frictional impact dynamics model to preview the impact-induced state jumps either for planning or control, see the recent example by the organizer Wang et al. [1], the impulsive manipulation example presented by our invited speaker Jia et al. [2].

To enable impact-awareness in the model-based motion generation paradigms of under-actuated robots, we need the frictional impact dynamics model to preview the impact-induced state jumps either for planning or control, see the recent example by the organizer Wang et al. [1], the impulsive manipulation example presented by our invited speaker Jia et al. [2].

The workshop presentation by [Jia Yan-bin](/speakers/yan-bin) will bring us the latest 3D impact dynamics model and its application for impulsive manipulation.
