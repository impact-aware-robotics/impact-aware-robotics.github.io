title: "Handling On-Purpose High Dynamic Tasks"
excerpt: "
In addition to the human-like kinematic structure, humanoids are expected to execute human-level of swift motions. However referring to the failing manipulation examples in the Darpa Robotics Challenge in 2015, the state-of-the-art humanoid robot control methods still need to applied close-to-zero contact velocity to establish external contacts.

In addition to the human-like kinematic structure, humanoids are expected to execute human-level of swift motions. However referring to the failing manipulation examples in the Darpa Robotics Challenge in 2015, the state-of-the-art humanoid robot control methods still need to applied close-to-zero contact velocity to establish external contacts.

To guarantee hardware feasibility and standing stability, recent model-based control design preview the impact-induced step changes, see Wang et al. (2020). However it is still not clear how to exploit the full kinematic and dynamic potential for high dynamic tasks.
