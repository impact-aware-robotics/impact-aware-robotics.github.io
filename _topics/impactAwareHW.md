title: "New Generation of Hardware with High Impact Afforadance"

excerpt: "
High dynamic motion between rigid bodies can lead to severe hardware failures due to abrupt changes in the velocities and torques. Without dedicated hardware or controllers, robots typically operate at a near-zero velocity in the vicinity of contacts.

High dynamic motion between rigid bodies can lead to severe hardware failures due to abrupt changes in the velocities and torques. Without dedicated hardware or controllers, robots typically operate at a near-zero velocity in the vicinity of contacts.

Hardware resilience to impact shall inform on how much impact a robot can perform without breaking links, joint mechanisms and embedded electronics.
Designing robust hardware specifically for high dynamic tasks is appealing, and notable progress has been made. Once we know the hardware capabilities in terms of impact resilience, we can consider impact-aware motion planning and control.
