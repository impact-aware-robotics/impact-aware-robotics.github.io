title: "Impact/Collision Detection"

excerpt: "
Impact instananeously changes the states of a robot. Earlier studies shows that it is able to generate considerablely high contact force jump within a few milliseconds Pashah et al. (2008). Thus timely impact/collision detection is vital to trigger the controller actions to take care of the post-impact state.
