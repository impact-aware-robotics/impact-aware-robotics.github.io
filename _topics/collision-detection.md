title: "Impact/Collision Detection"

excerpt: "
Impact instantaneously changes the states of a robot. Earlier studies shows that it is able to generate considerably high contact force jump within a few milliseconds Pashah et al. (2008). Thus timely impact/collision detection is vital to trigger the controller actions to take care of the post-impact state.

High dynamic motion leads to impact that can instantaneously change the states of a robot. Earlier studies shows that it is able to generate considerably high contact force jump within a few milliseconds Pashah et al. [1]. Thus timely impact/collision detection is vital to trigger the controller actions to take care of the post-impact state, see the analysis by our invited speaker Saccon et al. [2].

The workshop presentations by [Patrick Wensing](/speakers/wensing), and [Alessandro Saccon](/speakers/saccon) contribute to answer this question. The reliable impact detection leads to the impact-aware realtime re-planning by Patrick; and the novel hybrid control approach by Alessandro.
