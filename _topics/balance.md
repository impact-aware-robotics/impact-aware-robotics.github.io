title: "Whole-body Balancing Under Impacts"

excerpt: "
Despite the standing stability criterion for robots with sustained contacts has been established for decades, i.e., restricting the ZMP within the support polygon, it is not clear how to define the standing stability margin when the robot

  * executes high dynamic or impact motion,
  * has multiple non-coplanar contacts.
