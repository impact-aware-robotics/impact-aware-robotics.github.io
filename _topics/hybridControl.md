title: "Handling Task-Induced Impacts with Hybrid Control Approach"
excerpt: "We enable swift robot motion without fearing impacts with the environment. For instance in a box manipulation task, the robot does not need to stop or use close-to-zero velocity to establish contacts <br/><img src='/images/box-grabbing-crop.png'>"

Hybrid control is a powerful modeling and control tool for non-smooth mechanical systems in general. It has already achieved successful applications in practice, e.g., efficient bipedal walking by [Sreenath et al. (2011)](http://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/papers/MABEL_CompliantHZDWalking2010.pdf), walking over uneven terrain [Manchester et al.(2011)](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/62544/Tedrake_Stable%20dynamic.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), dynamic bipedal vertical climbing in simulation by [Aghasadeghi et al. (2012)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6225259/), and dynamic bipedal walking by [Reher et al. (2016)](https://aragorn.library.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/55476/ICRA2016_DURUS.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
