title: "Momentum-Based Control Design"

excerpt: "
Momentum-based control design has demonstrated convincing results for humanoid balancing. Wiedebach et al. (2016) managed to stabilize the ATLAS robot COM dynamics with upper-body motions when only partial footholds are available. The approach was recently summarized systematically by Koolen et al. (2016).

Momentum-based control design has demonstrated convincing results for humanoid balancing. Wiedebach et al. (2016) managed to stabilize the ATLAS robot COM dynamics with upper-body motions when only partial footholds are available. The approach was recently summarized systematically by Koolen et al. (2016). 

Despite the achievements, the momentum-based control design is an active research field with open questions such as:
  * What is the best control design to decouple the angular and linear momentum?
  * For robots performing in-air motions, how to represent the momentum with respect to the earth, to its COM, and to its floating-base?
