Call for contribution
Thank you for your interests of joining our workshop! We encourage 1-2 pages of extended abstract of relevant work in topics including but not limited to: impact-aware control, planning, hardware design, and practical-use cases. We can only document the accepted abstracts on the workshop website without post them in the official IEEE proceedings.

All the accepted papers will appear in the poster session. We allocate an extra 3-5 mins' introductory time slot for the selected papers in the regular sessions to promote the interaction. 

Deadline: April 15th, 2021
