### Research Interests: 

Iâ€™m broadly interested in applied optimization and control theory for dynamic, intelligent, and physically interactive robotic systems. To date, my research concentrates on bringing new levels of mobility to both legged robots and assistive devices. Current projects focus on control systems synthesis for extreme-terrain mobility in humanoids and quadrupeds, system identification for humans and robots, and human-machine interface technologies for assistive exoskeletons in rehabilitation. Please see my [publications](http://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/publications/) or [CV](http://sites.nd.edu/pwensing/cv/) for more detail.
