 I am a researcher specializing in robot dynamics and related fields.  I am currently a professor in the Department of Advanced Robotics at the Italian Institute of Technology.  I previously worked for many years at the Australian National University; and before that I was a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, an EPSRC Advanced Research Fellow in the Department of Engineering Science (Robotics Group), Oxford University, and a senior researcher at Philips Research Laboratories, Briarcliff Manor, New York.  I obtained my Ph.D. at Edinburgh University (Dept. of Artificial Intelligence), and my first degree at Southampton University.  I am regarded as one of the world's leading experts on rigid-body dynamics, and my publications have been cited thousands of times.  I am the inventor of the Articulated-Body Algorithm, and I am the author of the books Robot Dynamics Algorithms and Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms.  (See my [publications page](http://royfeatherstone.org/publist.html).)  I am also a Fellow of the IEEE and a member of its [Robotics and Automation Society](http://www.ieee-ras.org/).  For more information about my work, software, etc., follow the links on my [home page](http://royfeatherstone.org/index.html). 

### Balancing Made Simple

This paper presents a new model of the dynamics of a general planar robot balancing on a point in the plane, in which the essential parameters of the robot’s balancing behaviour are reduced to just two numbers, both of which are simple functions of basic physical properties of the robot mechanism. A third number describes the effect of other movements on the robot’s balance. This model gives rise to a simple preview balance controller consisting of a four-term control law with easily calculated gains and a reverse-time low-pass filter acting on a preview of the command signal. The filter makes the robot lean in anticipation of future movements. Simulation results are presented showing the balance controller achieving excellent tracking of large fast motion commands while simultaneously maintaining the robot’s balance and accurately rejecting disturbances caused by other motions being performed by the robot. The controller is also robust to effects such as actuator saturation and sensor noise.
