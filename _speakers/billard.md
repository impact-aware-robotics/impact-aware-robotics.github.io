##### Short Biography 

Professor Aude Billard is a Swiss physicist and pioneer in the fields of machine learning and human-robot interactions. As a full professor at the School of Engineering at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Billard’s research focuses on applying machine learning to support robot learning through human guidance in three complementary areas: 
 <ul>
  <li>
  the development of control systems for teaching robots through human demonstration;
  </li>
  <li>
  the study of the neural and cognitive processes underpinning imitation learning in humans;
  </li>
  <li>
  the design of user-friendly human-computer interfaces to facilitate human-robot interaction. 
</li>
</ul>
