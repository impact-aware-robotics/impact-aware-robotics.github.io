To promote the interaction between the presenter and the participant. We are collecting questions before the workshop. It works as follows: 

1. Collecting questions via the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHMeIUpCUg_JJ4n6H_AyZbw52do1YipF68DCQn1w2W_-icEA/viewform?usp=pp_url).

2. Forward all the questions to each presenter for review.

3. Announce the selected questions on each presenter's workshop page.

4. During the workshop, the corresponding presenter will address the questions after the presentation. 


Please use this opportunity to interact with your favorite expert(s)!
